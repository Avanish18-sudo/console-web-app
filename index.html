    A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
    <br>
     It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.
     <br>
      ... However, "terminal" may also be used to describe the software that runs on a console, such as a command line interface or remote access program.
